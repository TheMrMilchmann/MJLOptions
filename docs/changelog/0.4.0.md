### 0.4.0

_Not Yet Released_

#### Improvements

- Added support for annotation defined OptionPools.
- Added `Argument#build` as convenience for `Argument.builder(...).build()`.
- Added `Option#build` as convenience for `Option.builder(...).build()`.
- Added support for restricting option interplay (via `Restriction`).
    - Restrictions may be used to declare relations between options (e.g. if `A` is present, `B` must also be present)
    - Restrictions do not allow altering the principal semantics of options. (There is no way to force an option to be
      set.)
    - Several checks have been put in place to ensure that restrictions do not conflict.
- Refactored argument optionality to be configurable via `Argument.Builder`.
- Improved error reporting in several ways.
    - `ParsingException` now serves as supertype for all exceptions that may occur during parsing.
    - Added `UnrecognizedOptionException` that is now thrown for unrecognized options.
    - Added a `ConfigurationException` that now serves as supertype for all exceptions that may occur during
      configuration.
- Changed `ValueParser#BOOLEAN` to interpret all strings `"true"` as `true` regardless of casing

#### Breaking Changes

- Refactored `OptionParse#parse[...](...)` methods.
- Removed `Argument#builder(ValueParser, boolean)`.
